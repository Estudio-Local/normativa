#                                              not claiming regulatory weight)

✗ ${FILE_PATH##*/}: marker '${MARKER}' present, but canonical disclaimer text is missing.

Per rules/professional-disclaimer.md, every output that emits the
'norma:requires-disclaimer' marker must also include the canonical
"Análisis indicativo, no certificación..." block immediately above it.

Either add the disclaimer block, or remove the marker if this output
isn't regulatory.
